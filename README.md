## 🎓 Learning Statistics the Hard (and Fun) Way

Welcome! This repo is my personal journey through the book *Practical Statistics for Data Scientists*. I'm working through the chapters one by one, writing code, answering quiz questions, and doing mini-projects to really understand the material—not just read it.

All the exercises and quizzes are based on the book, and I'm just following along to cement the concepts in my brain (with Python, pandas, matplotlib, and a lot of trial and error 😅).

⚠️ **Heads up**: I haven’t finished the whole book yet. I’ll keep adding more chapters and exercises as I go. If you're learning too, feel free to clone the repo and follow along or use it for inspiration.
