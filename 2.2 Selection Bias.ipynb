    "**Answer:** Selection bias is the practice of unconciously or conciously selecting data in a way that is misleading. This is different from simple random sampling error because it is not an error that occurs from a miscount of the sample or the type of sample you choose. It occurs more from personal bias when you are over-analysing data in order to find something in it that will match your assumption."

    "This type of bias arises when the sample used in a study doesn't accurately reflect the characteristics of the broader population.

For instance, a study on a new drug might attract participants who are more motivated or engaged with their health, leading to a skewed view of the drug's effectiveness. "

For example, in business schools where \"Unicorns\" are celebrated as the standard when 90% of businesses are known fail. In this case, the failed business are ignored or forgotten making people think that having a successful business is the norm.\n",
